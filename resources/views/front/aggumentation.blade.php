                    <p>Staff augmentation is an outsourcing strategy which is used to staff a project and respond to
                        business objectives. The more a business grows, the more employees it has, and subsequently
                        a greater thrust on employee needs management. One of the most efficient and technologically
                        advanced ways of filling this need is to use staffing.<br><br>
                        Staffing involves finding the right people, with the right skills, abilities, and fit, who
                        may be hired or already working for the company or may be working for competing companies.
                        The technique consists of evaluating the existing staff and then determining which
                        additional skills are required.<br><br>
                        WeHire offers well qualified individuals and teams to staff virtually any project of any
                        size. We operate with flexible cost structure, keeping a mutually beneficial future
                        partnerships in hindsight. On offer are our full range of IT staffing services for:
