                    <h3>On-The Job Training (OJT)</h3>
                    <p>Many organizations attempt to use informal on-the-job training programs as a "low-cost" means
                        to train their employees. These programs generally involve teaming a new employee with a
                        more experienced one to learn how to do their assigned tasks.
                        Unfortunately, because of the lack of structure inherent in this informal approach, these
                        programs rarely deliver the desired results in a timely fashion. The weaknesses in these
                        informal OJT programs include:<br>
                        <strong>Lack of standard job and task documentation—</strong>Often these programs do not
                        have documented procedures describing how to perform the tasks that the new employee is
                        expected to learn.<br>
                        <strong>Lack of training ability—</strong>Experienced employees might be great at doing a
                        job, but not be effective at teaching others how to do it.<br>
                        <strong>Lack of objective evaluation criteria—</strong>Training of the new employee is
                        considered complete based on the subjective opinion of the experienced employee rather than
                        an objective evaluation of the new employee's skill and knowledge levels.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Improve your results with a structured approach to OJT.</strong><br>
                        WeHire helps you implement a structured approach to OJT. This involves working with your
                        subject matter experts to document, in step-by-step detail, all of the tasks that new
                        employees are expected to learn. It also includes identifying the performance standards for
                        each task.<br>
                        WeHire then creates OJT checklists—documents that show new employees exactly how to perform
                        their assigned tasks. And we create job performance measures (JPMs)—documents that show
                        experienced employees how to objectively evaluate their trainee's mastery of the assigned
                        task. Finally, we provide training to your experienced employees to enable them to be more
                        effective OJT trainers.
